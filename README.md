# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project plan

In this project, I will be making a header with links to other pages. These pages will just have a title and a simple message. The goal is to have a functional header that stays no matter which page is open.

a basic symbol will also be added up top that will also act as a home button. There will a link called home to do the same task
